Introduction
============

This package includes basic data structures, interfaces to the WSJ, Negra and
Cast3LB corpuses (English, German and Spanish respectively), and some baselines
and upper bounds computation code for unsupervised parsing (Klein and
Manning, 2004).

This work was done as part of the PhD in Computer Science I am doing in FaMAF,
Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina, under the supervision of
Gabriel Infante-Lopez, with a research fellowship from CONICET.

No direct usage instructions for now. Only to be used as dependency for other
software.
